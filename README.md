# Design-of-Bandgap-Reference-circuit-using-Brokaw-Cell

- CTAT due to BJT is nullified by creating PTAT within the circuit, thus resulting in constant reference voltage irrespective of temperature.
- The system has a temperature coefficient of 25 ppm/C.
- The design was tested with a different type of resistors and figure out that resnploy is the best case because of less variation in temperature and low power consumption.
- The startup circuit is designed to bring back the circuit to normal stage from zero stable stage.
- The circuit is analyzed for 15 worst-case corners and 300 runs of Monte Carlo analysis.
